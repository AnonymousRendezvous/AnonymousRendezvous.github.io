        <h2>Enjoy premium music</h2>
        <p>
          Each piece that has been released on my channel has underwent a lot of
          blood, sweat and tears just for it to pass my rigorous standards to be
          good enough to put it up and share with each one of you reading this
          right now.
        </p>

      <section class="ending">
        <h2>Original works - for FREE</h2>
        <p>
          As emphasised before, each one of my pieces are completely original
          (other than some exceptions like Rush-E) and are made to be enjoyed on
          their own or simply as a background music or soundtrack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope that by starting This channel I will continue to bring as much
          joy and happiness I can to brighten up our lives during these tough
          times. Thank you and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
